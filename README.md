# Conveyor Bag Counter
A simple streamlit app designed to count bags on a conveyor belt
## Usage
1. Download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dn-i_FYz7SbTIKoCfcZamOByGLO1ThQ1/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the root of the project.  
2. Run `docker compose up cpu` or `docker compose up gpu` depending on whether you have an NVIDIA GPU
3. Image build is going to take a while if you have slow internet connection
4. Go to `localhost:5000`
## Details
This is a minimal app, so the threshold line is hardcoded. Adjust if needed.
